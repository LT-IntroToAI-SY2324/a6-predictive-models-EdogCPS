# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r sqaured value is the correlation coefiient. it tells us how correletated the data is. 1 or -1 is extremly correcleted and 0 is no correlation. + means positive slope and - means negative slope. 

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
137.46 mmHg. 

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I think the model is acurate enough to predict within the provided data range. Outside of the selected data reange would be extrapolation. More data could alwasy improve the model.
