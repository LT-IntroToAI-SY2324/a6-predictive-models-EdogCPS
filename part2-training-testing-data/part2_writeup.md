# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
There is only one thing that makes this model more effective, it tells you how far off a predicted value is from its equivlanet data point. It gives you an idea of how off teh prediction line is. 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
It tells me how correleated the data is. The closer ot 1 or -1 the mroe correlated. closer to 0, the less. negative vlaue is a negative slpoe and positivie vlaue psotitive slope. 


3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say that my model is midely acurate. Strong enough to conceptually use but maybe not strong enough to trusts the exact prediction values.
