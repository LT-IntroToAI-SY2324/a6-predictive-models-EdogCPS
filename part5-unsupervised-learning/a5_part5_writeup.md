# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

Debters -  Lower income, higher spending.
realisitic - spend low, but make low
half_way_there - sped mid, make mid
Work_ard_play_hard - make big, spend big
Money_hog - make big, spend small

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

They would be between the half_way_there group and Money_hog. I think they should go in the money_hog group becasue if they made more moeny I would guess they stil wouldnt spend more.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

I am chosing the work_hard_play_hard group, I would advertise expensive things that allow you to enjoy the life you live, or quote on quote. They would be eager to makimize thier fun, and hier spending, just like they maximize everyhting else.
